# JSgame involving an unsuspecting traveler and a dragon encounter.

## A game I am working on in my spare time using javascript. Currently revamping from prompt boxes to the use of an input field.

### Known Issues:
    1. Yes it is incomplete, but slowly getting better.
        ##Update Jan 17
        Paths Flee and Steal are fully operational. Fight is still a work in progress.

### Goals
    1. Creating a multiple options/choices game with different outcomes depending on choices.
    2. Battling the dragon by taking out its max hp.
    3. Code clean up/revision.
    4. Fancy images to illustrate choices and consequences.
